            <p>I enjoy going camping with my friends, playing soccer just for fun, swimming, and trying out new things. Apply yourself is going to be a helpful tool for those students who don't have these type of resources at their school. Apply
              yourself will definitely make their search for college way easier. </p>

              <p> I enjoy singing, acting, reading, and playing tennis. Apply yourself tries to close the gap in the college application process, as there are some students who do not have access to applications like naviance or a college counselor
                who is willing to take the time to meet the student. This is mostly because of a financial problem as naviance can be quite expensive for some school districts. We wanted all students to have the same opportunity to understand the
                college process without financial burdens, so we created apply yourself!</p>

            <p> Hi, I'm Jen, one of the co-creators of Apply Yourself. I'm a rising senior (when did I get so old?) at New Trier High School. My hobbies include figure skating, krav maga, coding (obviously), reading, and designing. As someone whose
              parents constantly remind me of the college process--and the stress associated--I understand the difficulties of the college application process and wanted to create something to help ease it. I hope all of you find this website useful,
              and good luck!</p>
